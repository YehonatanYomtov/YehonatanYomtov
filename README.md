- Hi, I’m @YehonatanYomtov
- I’m a Full Stack developer in 
- I began my coding journey around three years ago, and in June 2024, I joined an intensive 3-month Full Stack Developer bootcamp at Developers Institute in Tel Aviv.
  During the program, I gained hands-on experience, earned my diploma, and won 1st place in a coding hackathon.
  Right after completing the bootcamp, I started a 2-month internship at Cyberlights AI,
  where I’ve been working ever since — contributing to real-world projects and continuing to grow as a developer.
